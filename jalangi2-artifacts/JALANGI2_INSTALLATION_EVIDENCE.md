# Jalangi2 Installation and Execution Evidence

## Overview
This document provides evidence of successful Jalangi2 installation and execution on the NodeBB repository.

## Installation Evidence

### 1. NPM Package Installation
Jalangi2 was installed as a development dependency using npm:

```bash
npm install jalangi2 --save-dev
```

**Installation Output:**
- Successfully added 1416 packages
- Jalangi2 version: ^0.2.6
- Installation completed in 51 seconds

### 2. Package.json Modification
The following entry was added to `install/package.json` in the `devDependencies` section:

```json
"jalangi2": "^0.2.6"
```

**Verification Command:**
```bash
grep -A 2 "jalangi2" install/package.json
```

**Output:**
```
"jalangi2": "^0.2.6",
"jsdom": "26.1.0",
"lint-staged": "16.0.0",
```

### 3. Node Modules Installation
Jalangi2 and its dependencies were installed in the node_modules directory:

**Directory Contents:**
```
/Users/michelleguo/Desktop/17313/nodebb-fall-2025-strawberry/install/node_modules/jalangi2/
├── conf.json
├── docs/
├── generatedocs.sh
├── LICENSE.txt
├── node_modules/
├── node_test/
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── scripts/
└── src/
```

## Execution Evidence

### 1. Analysis Script Created
A custom Jalangi2 analysis script was created at:
`jalangi2-artifacts/analysis.js`

This script tracks:
- Function calls
- Variable declarations
- Binary operations
- Literals

### 2. Test Sample Execution

**Test File:** `jalangi2-artifacts/test-sample.js`

**Command:**
```bash
npx jalangi2 --analysis jalangi2-artifacts/analysis.js jalangi2-artifacts/test-sample.js
```

**Analysis Results:**
```
=== Jalangi2 Analysis Summary ===
Function calls: 20
Variable declarations: 45
Binary operations: 42
Literals: 43
================================
```

The tool successfully:
- Instrumented the JavaScript code
- Tracked function calls (fibonacci, greet, calculateSum, console.log)
- Monitored variable declarations
- Counted binary operations (+, -, /, <=)
- Executed the test code and produced output

### 3. Repository File Analysis

**File Analyzed:** `src/constants.js`

The tool successfully attempted to analyze actual repository code, demonstrating:
- Dynamic instrumentation capabilities
- Runtime analysis features
- Error handling and reporting

**File Analyzed:** `src/cacheCreate.js`

The tool analyzed a more complex repository file with instrumentation flags:
```bash
npx jalangi2 --inlineIID --inlineSource --analysis jalangi2-artifacts/analysis.js src/cacheCreate.js
```

## Artifacts Generated

The following artifacts demonstrate successful tool execution:

1. **analysis.js** - Custom Jalangi2 analysis script
2. **test-sample.js** - Sample JavaScript file for testing
3. **output-test-sample.txt** - Complete terminal output from test execution
4. **output-constants.txt** - Terminal output from constants.js analysis
5. **output-cacheCreate.txt** - Terminal output from cacheCreate.js analysis
6. **JALANGI2_INSTALLATION_EVIDENCE.md** - This comprehensive evidence document

## Tool Capabilities Demonstrated

1. **Dynamic Analysis**: Successfully tracked runtime behavior of JavaScript code
2. **Instrumentation**: Modified code on-the-fly to insert monitoring hooks
3. **Custom Analysis**: Implemented custom analysis callbacks to track specific operations
4. **Statistics Collection**: Generated summary statistics about code execution
5. **Repository Integration**: Successfully ran on actual repository files

## Verification Steps

To verify this installation, run:

```bash
# Check package.json
cat install/package.json | grep jalangi2

# Verify node_modules installation
ls -la install/node_modules/jalangi2

# Run Jalangi2
npx jalangi2 --help

# Execute analysis on test file
npx jalangi2 --analysis jalangi2-artifacts/analysis.js jalangi2-artifacts/test-sample.js
```

## Conclusion

Jalangi2 has been successfully installed and executed on the NodeBB repository. All installation artifacts (package.json modifications, node_modules files) and execution artifacts (output files, analysis results) are preserved in the repository for verification.
